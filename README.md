# Assembly Language Programs  

This repository contains assembly language programs created as part of a university course (Computer Organization & Assembly Language) BSCS6th A. The programs are written in **x86 Assembly Language** for **DOS**, using the **MASM (Microsoft Macro Assembler)** syntax.  

## Contents  

### Program Files  
1. **`01_Print.asm`**  
   - Simple program to print a character in assembly language.  

2. **`02_Print2.asm`**  
   - Displays a string in assembly language.  

3. **`03_Sum.asm`**  
   - Adds two numbers and displays the result.  

4. **`04_Sum2.asm`**  
   - Adds two user-defined numbers and displays the result.  

5. **`05_Input.asm`**  
   - Takes a character input from the user and displays it.  

6. **`06_Input2.asm`**  
   - Takes two numbers as input from the user, sums them, and displays the result.  

### Assignment  
- **`Assingment#2.asm`**  
  - Declares three integer variables initialized to `4`, `5`, and `7`.  
  - Adds these numbers and stores the result in a fourth variable called `answer`.  

### Additional Files  
- **`imp.jpeg`**  
  - Image file containing concepts related to variables and data types.  

- **`impNote.txt`**  
  - Note file specifying that all programs are written in x86 assembly language for DOS, using MASM syntax.  

## Prerequisites  

To run these programs, you'll need:  
- **MASM** (Microsoft Macro Assembler)  
- A DOS-compatible environment (e.g., DOSBox)  

## How to Run  

1. Assemble the program using MASM:  
   ```bash
   masm filename.asm;
   ```  
2. Link the assembled file:  
   ```bash
   link filename.obj;
   ```  
3. Run the executable:  
   ```bash
   filename.exe
   ```
